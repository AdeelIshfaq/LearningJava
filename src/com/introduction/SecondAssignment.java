 *Create a class called Stack. The class should support the basic operations:

1. push - push an element to the top of the stack.
2. pop - delete an element from the top of the stack.
3. peek - display an element at the top of the stack.
4. size - return the size of the stack.

Your stack should be dynamic meaning the size should not be fixed. You can keep adding elements to it.
Your stack can throw an exception if pop is called on an empty stack.
